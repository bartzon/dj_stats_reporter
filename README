DJ Stats
========

After seeing the Github guys release Resque, I wanted the same monitoring functionality for Delayed Job. So, DJ Stats was born. It hooks into the lifecycle of a Delayed::Job, and reports data back to DJ Stats. This plugin is the reporter part, for the monitoring application see http://github.com/bartzon/dj_stats

Installation:
-------------
Install the plugin with:

	./script/plugin install git://github.com/bartzon/dj_stats_reporter.git

Create a file called dj_stats.yml in RAILS_ROOT/config with the following format:

	dj_stats:
  	application_name: Application name
  	stats_url: URL to the DJ Stats app
